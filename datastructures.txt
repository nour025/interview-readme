Data Structures & Algorithms I’m Not Fully Confident In

Bitmask – I understand it’s related to using bits for representing states or subsets, but I haven’t practiced enough to apply it efficiently in problem-solving.

Graph Structures – While I know what graphs are, I still get confused about the differences between adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, and when to use each.

Union-Find (Disjoint Set) – I’ve read about it being used for detecting connected components or cycles in graphs, but I haven’t implemented it enough to be comfortable with the logic.

Graph Traversal – I understand the concepts of BFS and DFS in theory, but I need more practice applying them to different graph problems.

Steiner Tree – Completely new to me; I haven’t learned how it works or where it’s applied in optimization problems.

NP-complete Reductions – I understand NP-complete problems are hard to solve, but I’m not confident in identifying them or reducing one problem to another.
